This repo is for a project I've been thinking of for a long time.
The is going to be a webapp that allows people to create a party ID that is then used to vote up or down songs at a party.
Other apps like this exist however most require a desktop being used or an app to download. The purpose of this app is that users can have a mobile friendly website that it intuitive and sleek.
