This repo is for a project I've been thinking of for a long time.

The is going to be a webapp that allows people to create a party. This party has an ID that is then used to vote up or down songs for a party playlist using the spotify api.

Other apps like this exist, however most require a desktop website being used or an app that users must download. The purpose of this app is that users can have a mobile friendly website that it intuitive and sleek.
